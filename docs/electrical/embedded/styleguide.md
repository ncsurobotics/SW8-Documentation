## Overview
This guide follows the general outline and some of the recommendations of the "[Embedded C Coding Standard](https://barrgroup.com/embedded-systems/books/embedded-c-coding-standard)", set forth by Michael Barr. Wherever a rule does not differ from those set out by Mr. Barr, the rule will be directly referenced in the format ```section.subsection.rule```, but not directly quoted. Therefore, this guide is meant to work more as an overlay to the rules set out by Mr. Barr that better suits the preferences of the club.
