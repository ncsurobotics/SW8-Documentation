## MOAB / FOAB

The **M**other **O**f **A**ll **B**oards (MOAB) and **F**ather **O**f **A**ll **B**oards (FOAB) are the two copies of the electrical system use in SeaWolf VIII. MOAB and FOAB refer to the whole assembly on which the electronic system is assembled. It also serves to mean "the whole electrical system" for the purposes of most documentation.

There are two such boards, however the two are rarely identical. The idea is that one is a stable platform (and in active use by software at pool tests) while the other is the electrical team's working platform. Once electrical team finishes making and testing changes, the working and stable platforms swap.

For example, if MOAB is stable and used in the robot, a new board could be added to FOAB. Once added and verified, FOAB and MOAB would be swapped making FOAB the stable system. MOAB would then be updated to match FOAB's changes and the next set of changes would occur on MOAB.
