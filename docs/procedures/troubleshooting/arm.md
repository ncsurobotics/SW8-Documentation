# Troubleshooting Arming
If you do not here all 5 beeps when arming the robot, it means that the ESCs are not fully initialized. See [BlueRobotics ESC Beeps](https://bluerobotics.com/learn/thruster-usage-guide/#esc-beeps) for further explanation.

1. First, check that both batteries are connected
2. If the issue persists, disarm and reboot the robot
3. If the issue still persists, it is likely that the control board somehow disconnected. The robot will need to be opened to ensure that everything is connected.
